## Overview
This application simulates the evolution of variants of a positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus i.e. SARS-CoV-2. It includes three phases of evolution which is the initial phase, vaccination phase and the end phase where there might be a possible delta variant.
## Aim:
To study the evolution of variants of SARS-cov-2 using Genetic Algorithm. To simulate reproduction
of virus in series of hosts who are either   
 (a). Naive (not Infected, not Vaccinated)  
 (b). Previously Infected  
 (c). Vaccinated  
 (d). Previously Infected and vaccinated.  
 ## Steps to run the application:   
 - Download/Clone the repository
 - Open project in any IDE preferably NetBeans and use Java 8 or above
 - Resolve any JAR related issues(if occured) by importing libraries from Jars folder
 - Run the Application
 - For further guide, you may take a look at the demo video
